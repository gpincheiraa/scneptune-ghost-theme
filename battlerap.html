  While at Cheri Media, I was part of an upstart engineering department for a music publication that was seeking to break into new territory. Cheri Media's property HipHopDX had become a flagship in the Complex network for News, Commentary and Culture. Seeking to expand on the fiercly loyal and captive audience of Hip Hop heads, Cheri Media embarked on developing a new online publication for the Battle Rap subculture.

  In 2014 I was part of the launch of Battle Rap. Working close concert with another backend engineer we were able to launch the property in 4 months. At the culmination of a years worth of hard hitting Battle Rap journalism, I was tasked with creating a unique page to show case all of the best  artists from 2014.

<p>
  In the tradition of other news publications at the time, we sought create a magazine-like "Super Feature" piece that broke our typical news layout. Taking inspiration from other parallax sites like
   <i>The New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/">"Snow Fall"</a> project, I workshopped with our Head Designer Nina Zidani, 3 or 4 iterations of the awards layout. Development was complete in 5 weeks, and launched in May 2015 <span class="v-top">*</span>.

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Due to the complexity of the fidelity of the line-art used for each battle rapper, non-desktop retina images required extra usability testing.
  <li>
  <li>
    Due to editorial constraints and limited access, content for the Battle Rap Awards was not released until early May of the following year. Despite this fact, there over 200+ comments on the page and BattleRap's traffic spiked to over 215% from daily readership.
